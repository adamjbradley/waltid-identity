# Payment Wallet Attestation (EWC RFC007)
#
# !! DISABLED BY DEFAULT !!
#
# This feature is OFF by default and requires explicit opt-in.
# When disabled, there is zero impact on existing credential issuance flows.
#
# To enable, either:
#   1. Set environment variable: PWA_ENABLED=true
#   2. Change 'enabled = false' to 'enabled = true' below
#   3. Add 'pwa' to enabledFeatures in _features.conf
#
# This feature implements EWC RFC007 for binding payment funding sources
# (cards, bank accounts) to EUDI wallets via the PaymentWalletAttestation
# credential type.

# Master switch - DEFAULTS TO FALSE
# Can be overridden via PWA_ENABLED environment variable
enabled = false
enabled = ${?PWA_ENABLED}

# PSP adapter: "mock" for testing, or fully qualified class name for production
# Example production: "com.example.MyPspAdapter"
pspAdapterType = "mock"
pspAdapterType = ${?PWA_PSP_ADAPTER}

# Credential configuration ID (should match the credential type in metadata)
credentialConfigurationId = "PaymentWalletAttestation"
