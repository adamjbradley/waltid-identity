# Payment Wallet Attestation (EWC RFC007) - Docker Deployment Config
#
# !! DISABLED BY DEFAULT !!
#
# This feature is OFF by default and requires explicit opt-in.
# When disabled, there is zero impact on existing credential issuance flows.
#
# To enable in Docker:
#   1. Create .env.local with: PWA_ENABLED=true
#   2. Or set environment variable: PWA_ENABLED=true
#   3. Then restart: docker compose --profile identity up -d issuer-api
#
# This feature implements EWC RFC007 for binding payment funding sources
# (cards, bank accounts) to EUDI wallets via the PaymentWalletAttestation
# credential type.

# Master switch - DEFAULTS TO FALSE
# Overridden via PWA_ENABLED environment variable from docker-compose
enabled = false
enabled = ${?PWA_ENABLED}

# PSP adapter: "mock" for testing, or fully qualified class name for production
# Example production: "com.example.MyPspAdapter"
pspAdapterType = "mock"
pspAdapterType = ${?PWA_PSP_ADAPTER}

# Credential configuration ID (should match the credential type in metadata)
credentialConfigurationId = "PaymentWalletAttestation"
